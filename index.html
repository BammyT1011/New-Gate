										<h3 class="seremon-title">Arrows and Battles</h3>
										<p>Skulls, spoils and blood;
Was the story of all the battles.
Kings: they laid bare their defences.
Truism is it? Lust at its peak:
Said the sensible intellectuals,
Wars do not need arrows to birth themselves.

The scars, the casualties – infanticide;
When the pardigm shifts to skirts to fight the battle,
They feel pain and torture, the throes of yesterday scars.
Is it the death row on the dog-nose mornings,
Or the heart torn out of its place with forceful piercings.

We are victorious; let's call in the wine, bread and berries;
It was an empire we have to conquer,
They were rich and we were sad,
At the end, our victory was temporary.

Our sister empires came all dress in armour,
Why dress this way to a battle with a friend?
They came unclad! 
We won again!

The bastards came in droves,
They hackneyed us to death, why?
We have forgotten our unborn children,
We killed their mothers.
In soul and tales, their future we took.
We are victorious!

Now the time has come to face our battles,
But now our arrow has weaned us,
We pine over our victory,
We should have known;
The battles and the cries of our arrows were illusions and charades.

					Talents and education are not waste to be thrown away. We are known to pushing out the GATE in you…….<br>
					<br>
					<b>Problem defination</b> <br>
					Nigeria a great nation ,filled with unique human resources, lots of Nigerians feel very proud about the 
					abundance of talents in the country.However, there are few Nigerian that are among the greatest
					 in sports, science, art, or any major field at all ,why is that? With brain drain being an issue.
					 Certain factors are preventing gifted young Nigerians from reaching their potential Most parents 
					 already have a picture of What they think their children should do in life, based on what they think
					  is best for them in terms of prestige, societal expectations, status e.t.c and not valueing his /her gifts.
					  The Environment: People in the environment learn from experience that the society does not favour creativity
					   and does not reward talents, so they don’t feel motivated to work and develop it..
					   A consequence of all these systemic problems is that Nigeria is lagging behind on a global level in nearly 
					   every field despite its enormous potential. It’s pathetic to see youth within Nigeria suffering from motivation, 
					   identity crisis (who am i),sense of hopelessness e.t.c.
					   The parents and the government need to be supported in lifting the future generation.

					   This initiative, is born out of the need of selfless service to humanity at the University of Ilorin, 
					   and moving round all campuses and states in Nigeria and aiming to equip and empower the youth so that t
					   hey can be pillars of the Nigeria economy.</p>
					<p><b>Needs Assessment</b><br>
					Youths in Nigeria need a platform to discover, develop and exhibit their potentials. 
					Many of this youth seek greener pastures abroad thereby risking their lives because 
					they lack opportunity to explore and demonstrate their creative and intelligence. 
					This initiative will help to connect youths to their long sort opportunity and explore 
					the world of entrepreneurship.<br><br>
					<b>Solution/Strategy</b></br>
					GATE Initiative is born to educate and encourage the youths via her social media handles, 
					organizing effective programs, talents shows, counselling,motivational events,workshops,
					summits,campaigns etc.Using proven, committed faculties and methodologies. Through this events, 
					youths should be able to sustain their lives and contribute meaningfully to the society at large.<br><br>
